### Reproduction of the results:
In parenthesis are the corresponding R script numbers.
- Launch simulations - (serialize using `launcher_generator.R`) - can launch `Launch_BurninGeneRation.R` - The Launcher for two simulations: adaptation in two successive environements - in bash
- Extract simu features and isolate successful ones (`022`) - in bash (or by hand as shown in "Notebook_&_useful functions").
- Count degree (`060`)
- FIG01: check and plot simu, fit and plot degree (`099`)
- FIG02: compare adaptation profiles (`103`)
- Carry out mutation tests (`073`+`128`)
- FIG03: Plot fitness effects (`115`)
- FIG04: Plot cis-effects and pleiotropy (`182`)
- FIG05: Enrichment analysis (`171`)

See also in the folder "Notebook_&_useful functions" to carry out the mutations by hand and get familiar with the scripts.

Note that the "Extracted data" folder used several times in the scripts are simple a destination or storing folder to be modified at will.
