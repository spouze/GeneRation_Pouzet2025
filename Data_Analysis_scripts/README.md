### Reproduction of the results:

</br>
In the `GeneRation_Data_Analysis_pack.zip` archive you will find: 
- The main script `211.GeneRation_Analyses_code_Dryad.R` allowing for the reproduction of the data analysis workflow
- Two functions-carrying R files (`GeneRation_DataAnalysis_FUN.R`and `GeneRation_Fun_v1.R`)
- The folder `SIMULATIONS` containing raw data from 2 succesful simulations that were generated for the paper and used here as simple example for data treatment
- The folder `Extracted_data` used as destination folder to store extracted output from raw simulation data

</br>
The script `211.GeneRation_Analyses_code_Dryad.R` that is the main script to launch in R or Rstudio, containing blocks of code leading to
- Exctracting data from the simulations stored in the `SIMULATIONS` folder. This includes:
  - `storeFits_`, a dataframe containing fitnesses of simulations, where each row corresponds to a simulation and each column to a generation
  - `storeJustLastFits_`, a dataframe containing final fitnesses of simulations, where each row corresponds to a simulation with a column containing the final fitness
  - `storeLasts_`, a dataframe containing the final row from the `MMDD_HHMMSS_simulation.table` generated by the simulation. Thus, it stores the details of the last generation of all simulations, where each row corresponds to a simulation.
- Loading and spliting of this type of extracted data in 3 topologies, and the selection of successful simulations
- Ploting adaptation lines (Figure 3)
- Ploting Network distributions (Figure 2)
- Carrying out multiple mutations tests of simulation results and estimating their impact to generate a dataframe `allmutations_` that will contain the results for each of those mutation tests.
- Plotting fitness effects (Figure 4)
- Plotting pleiotropy and cis-acting effects (Figure 5)
- Plotting mutations properties (Figure 6)

Note that the `Extracted_data` folder used several times in the scripts is simply a destination or storing folder to be modified at will.</br>
See also in the folder "Notebook_&_useful functions" for other representations and simpler analyses for single simulations (one by one approach).
